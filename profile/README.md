## We are transitIOM

### Our goal make sure you never have to look at a pdf timetable again.
Having dealt with the horrible task of searching through the Bus Vannin website to get the right timetable, we had enough.
We have set out to make a mobile app, where all you have to do it enter a destination, and it will guide you.

### Features
- Mobile friendly interface, saves zooming into PDFs
- Simple journey planner
  - Figures out what busses to take for you
  - Supports transfers
- Everything you need to get around in one place
- Free and Open Source
